## a minecraft 1.8.9 texture pack

This texturepack was a photoshop of other texturepacks that I've liked. I added a few things here and there, but most of the credit goes to the original creators of the texturepacks that I used.

Since I made this several years ago, a lot of the creators might've gone uncredited, but I added the ones that I could remember.
